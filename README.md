# Secure Intake & Case Workflow Engine

Reusable open-source infrastructure for secure intake, case management, workflow routing, deadlines, review, and administrative due process.

## Design goals

- Statute-neutral core primitives
- Organization-scoped data and deny-by-default authorization
- Configurable intake, workflows, deadlines, reviews, and terminology
- Explicit public/private information boundaries
- Append-only audit history for material actions
- Stable REST/OpenAPI and event interfaces
- Thin downstream applications for legislation-specific workflows

## Current milestone

**PR 4 — configurable intake and form engine**

This milestone adds schema-driven intake definitions, immutable published versions, conditional fields, validation, public form rendering, anonymous resumable drafts, confirmation codes, form administration, and submission persistence pinned to the exact form version used.

Form behavior now lives primarily in validated configuration rather than statute-specific application code.

See [docs/development.md](docs/development.md) for local setup and [docs/architecture](docs/architecture) for architectural decisions.

## Security status

This repository is an open-source engine and is **not** an accredited system for classified information. Deployments handling sensitive information require additional controls, review, and authorization appropriate to their use.
