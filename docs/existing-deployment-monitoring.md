# Existing production destinations and monitoring

This engine already has a known Render preview: **https://secure-intake-preview.onrender.com**. Do not create a duplicate service merely because `render.yaml` is checked in. Verify the correct Render workspace and existing service before changing its deployment.

The dedicated Neon project is named **Secure Intake Case Workflow Engine**. It is separate from the National Secure Ideas Submission database. Database migrations require an authorized target database, backup/restore plan, and confirmed secrets; the engine does not silently provision a second database.

## Independent public health check

`.github/workflows/existing-preview-health.yml` runs a read-only check of the existing preview every 15 minutes (GitHub scheduling is best-effort), on pushes to `main`, and by manual dispatch. No Render or Neon access token is required for the check. The endpoints are public and return only coarse information.

The check verifies:
- HTTPS liveness at `/api/health`;
- HTTPS PostgreSQL readiness at `/api/ready`;
- two identical runtime version claims matching the checked-out `package.json`.

If the preview lags the released engine or lacks `DATABASE_URL`, the check will **fail**, and GitHub Actions will display the failure. This is a useful *detection* result, not a proof of an outage or a substitute for a real production acceptance test. A sleeping free-tier service or upstream connectivity issue can also fail a scheduled check. The health workflow does not deploy code, apply migrations, release documents, scan malware, or configure a worker.

## Engine Room

Engine Room already lists the existing service's repository and Render URL. Provider refresh and public-site checks are separate from this GitHub Actions monitor. For full monitoring, the Engine Room deployment must run its own scheduler/ingestion and show source timestamps and freshness. This workflow provides a GitHub-accessible smoke-check result in the meantime.

## Deployment boundary

The root `render.yaml` is a **new-install template** and is not an instruction to apply a second Blueprint on top of the existing preview. Prefer updating the existing authorized Render service's pinned release image and current variables after confirming its ownership and deployment credentials. Follow `docs/deployment-production.md` before handling live, confidential or sensitive submissions.
