# Secure Intake & Case Workflow Engine — recovered original development plan and independent-account handoff

**Historical source:** Original October 5 generic 20-milestone plan plus October 6-9 security and operational extensions. Numbered 20-milestone original roadmap recovered from the previous conversations and cross-checked with checked-in roadmap and technical documentation. This document preserves original scope and, where applicable, separates later extensions. Technical per-item acceptance language is an engineering elaboration rather than a purported verbatim transcript; a milestone ID is **not** a GitHub PR number.

## Product mandate and governing boundaries

Multi-tenant, configurable case and evidence workflow platform that supports varied statutory and administrative applications. Core owns reusable intake forms, case IDs, routing, roles, appeals, correspondence, deadlines, external participant access, append-only audit and release safety. National Secure Ideas is a separate thin app. No bill-specific terminology, eligibility or statutes are hardcoded into the upstream engine.

The original 20-stage baseline has changed through many later releases and separate downstream National Secure Ideas work. PR32 was reported closed/superseded in a later conversation and equivalent work in another PR; do not mark numbered tasks merged solely from position. Current Render health and Neon readiness must be tested independently.

## Execution / release / status rules

1. Read this plan plus the checked-in policy/data model, ADRs, current README and linked runbooks. Discover open and merged actual PRs, CI, image versions, migration versions, release tags, live Render/Neon state and dependent app contract versions; never trust outdated conversational status.
2. Create and maintain a mapping **roadmap ID → GitHub PR(s) → tests → release/deployment evidence**, preserving historical 2026 plan numbering and app-specific changes as separately versioned additions. Only verified merged functionality counts toward development; production evidence is independent.
3. Keep the engine reusable where applicable. Enforce documented negative paths, role/tenant leakage, audit integrity and source validity. Avoid unreviewed policy in upstream code, mock approval of legal obligations, and claims of real-world regulatory compliance from fictional cases.
4. Continue implementation in small chained PRs with required tests, migrations, review of security implications and rollback plan; stop when permissions, credentials, external provider/legal requirements or failing gates make it necessary. Consult the user only for material product and real credentials/authorization decisions.
5. Require real environment health/readiness, DB migrations, backup restoration, media/document storage and malware scanning where applicable, accessibility/security review and demonstrated end-to-end consumer flows before calling a production release complete.

## Recovery confidence

**The original 20 ordered milestones are recovered** and supported by the previous conversation and current repository docs. Current code/CI/live deployment evidence is not established by creating this document.
